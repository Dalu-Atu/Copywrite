            The Problem with Handwritten Notes
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            For you to be here I will like to assume you know that feeling? The
            one when you're scribbling down ideas in a meeting, or your kid's
            drawing you a picture with a little note, or you're just jotting
            down a grocery list, or typing written notes for an organization ?
            It's real, it's personal. We all still write stuff down, even with
            phones glued to our hands. But then what? That brilliant idea you
            had in that notebook? Stuck on paper. Those lecture notes you took?
            A mess to share. And trying to get that grocery list into your
            phone? Ugh. That's where {""}

            comes in. Think of it as your digital bridge. You snap a picture of
            your handwritten stuff, and poof! It turns into something you can
            actually use on your computer. Like, real text you can edit, just
            like in Word. And those tables you drew? Copywrite can even turn
            them into an Excel sheet. No more typing it all out. It's like
            magic, but for your messy notes. Below is a live video of an image
            being converted to a text on the go

            Why Handwritten Notes Can Hold You Back
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
            While the tactile experience of handwriting is cherished, its
            limitations in today's fast-paced digital environment are evident:
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              <li>
                <b>Organization and Accessibility:</b> Physical notes are prone
                to loss, damage, and disorganization. Searching through stacks
                of paper is time-consuming and inefficient.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b> Sharing and Collaboration:</b> Sharing handwritten notes
                requires cumbersome scanning and emailing, hindering real-time
                collaboration.
              </li>
              <li>
                Editing and Revision: Correcting errors or updating information
                on handwritten notes is tedious and often results in messy
                markups.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b> Data Extraction and Analysis:</b> Transcribing tables and
                structured data from handwritten notes into spreadsheets for
                analysis is a laborious and error-prone task.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b> Environmental Impact:</b> Excessive paper use contributes to
                deforestation.
              </li>
            </ul>
